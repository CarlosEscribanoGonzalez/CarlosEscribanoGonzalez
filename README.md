# Carlos Escribano - Video Game Design and Development Student

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Carlos Escribano**, a Video Game Design and Development student at **Rey Juan Carlos University**, Madrid. Iâ€™m passionate about creating video games and actively work on various projects, both in my studies and in **Game Jams**, contributing to narrative and programming tasks.

### Experience

I have solid experience with **Unity**, where Iâ€™ve developed multiple projects in **2D**, **3D**, and **VR**. I'm planning to specialize in Virtual Reality, an area where I received honors and plan to continue developing my skills. However, I can handle myself in other programming languages besides **C#**, such as **C++**, **JavaScript**, **Java**, and **Python**.  
I have also worked with other frameworks and engines, such as **Phaser** and **RPG Maker**, and I'm willing to learn Unreal Engine.

### Projects

On this page, you can find all the projects I have worked on throughout my career. I hope you enjoy them as much as I enjoyed creating them!
